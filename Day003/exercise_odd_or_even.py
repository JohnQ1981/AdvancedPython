# Instructions
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43

# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5

# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

# e.g. 6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder.
